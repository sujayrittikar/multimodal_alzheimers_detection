* The patient's age is 75, which is older than the average age of AD patients.
* The patient's genotype is 3/3, which is a common genetic mutation associated with AD.
* The patient's CDGlobal score is 0.5, which is higher than the average CDGlobal score for AD patients.
* The patient's CDRSB score is 0.5, which is also higher than the average CDRSB score for AD patients.
* The patient's MMScore is 29.0, which is higher than the average MMScore for AD patients.
* The patient's HMScore is nan, which is not a reliable indicator of cognitive function.
* The patient's NPIScore is 4.0, which is lower than the average NPIScore for AD patients.
* The patient's GDTotal score is 2.0, which is lower than the average GDTotal score for AD patients.

I118692,MCI,"
            - Image features: The sagittal MRI may show subtle hippocampal volume reduction or minor atrophy that could indicate mild cognitive impairment but not definitive Alzheimer's features.
            - Clinical details: The patient is 85 years old with a genotype of 3/4 which is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's, and an MMSCORE of 28.0 suggests mild cognitive impairment rather than severe decline or normal cognition."
I64025,CN,"
            - Image features: The MRI scan depicts a typical pattern of cerebral structure without significant atrophy or other abnormalities commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Brain regions appear well-preserved.
            - Clinical details: The patient is 86 years old with a genotype of 3/4, but has a high MMSCORE of 30.0, indicating no cognitive impairment. This score suggests normal cognitive function despite the age-related risks."
I40966,MCI,"
            - Image features: The MRI scan may show some age-related atrophy but not definitive signs of advanced Alzheimer's.
            - Clinical details: At 85 years old, with a genotype of 3/4 and an MMSCORE of 28.0, the patient could be experiencing mild cognitive impairment rather than full-blown Alzheimer's Disease."
I45108,MCI,"
            - Image features: The MRI scan might show signs of atrophy or changes associated with early cognitive decline, but specific features are not provided in the prompt.
            - Clinical details: The patient is 85 years old, with a high MMSCORE of 28.0 suggesting that cognitive function is relatively good but may show signs of decline given their age. The genotype of 3/4 can be associated with Alzheimer's risk, and a GDTOTAL of 1.0 could imply some level of cognitive impairment, placing the patient in the MCI category."
